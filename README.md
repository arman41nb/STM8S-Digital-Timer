STM8S Digital Timer
This project is a digital timer based on the STM8S103K3T6C microcontroller, designed to control an external load such as a relay or DC motor with flexible and precise timing intervals.

Users can configure two independent durations:

The waiting time (delay before activation)

The ON time (duration the output stays active)

For example, the device can be set to activate every 4 hours for 5 minutes.
A three-position switch allows selecting a wide time range from 1 second up to 99 days.
The output is driven through a transistor, capable of controlling loads such as relays or small DC motors up to 200 mA at 3 V.

The design emphasizes very low cost and simplicity, making it suitable for automation, hobby, and educational applications.

üß† Features

Dual time interval (delay + on-time)

Adjustable from 1 second to 99 days

Transistor output driver (up to 200 mA)

Simple 3-button user interface

7-segment numeric display

Compact and single-sided PCB

Designed with Altium Designer

Firmware written in Keil (C for STM8S)

Final software version: March 2024

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The user sets two time values (wait and active durations).

The microcontroller counts down the delay period.

Once the waiting time ends, it turns the output ON for the configured duration.

The transistor output stage can drive a relay, LED, or small DC motor.

The 7-segment display shows current timing values, and buttons are used for configuration and mode selection.
